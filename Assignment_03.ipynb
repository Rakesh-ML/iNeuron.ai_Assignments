    "#### 2. When does the code in a function run: when it's specified or when it's called?\n",
    "**Ans:** The code in a function runs **when it's called**, not when it's specified.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "1. **Defining a function**: Only specifies what the function does (its logic) but does not execute it.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def greet():\n",
    "       print(\"Hello!\")\n",
    "       \n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Calling a function**: Executes the code inside the function.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   greet()  # Output: Hello!\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Point**: A function runs only when explicitly called in the program."

    "#### 3. What statement creates a function?\n",
    "**Ans:** The **`def`** statement creates a function in Python.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "##### Example:\r\n",
    "```python\r\n",
    "def greet():\r\n",

    "#### 4. What is the difference between a function and a function call?\n",
    "**Ans:** A function is procedure to achieve a particular result. while function call is using this function to achive that task. Using a function to do a particular task any point in program is called as function call. "

    "#### 5. How many global scopes are there in a Python program? How many local scopes?\n",

   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "#### 6. What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call returns?\n",

    "#### 7. What is the concept of a return value? Is it possible to have a return value in an expression?\n",
    "**Ans**: A return value is the value that a function call evaluates to. Like any value, a return value can be used\n",
    "as part of an expression."

    "**Difference Between a Function and a Function Call**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Function**:\n",
    "   - A block of code defined using the `def` keyword.\n",

    "     greet()  # Calls the greet function and prints \"Hello!\"\n",

    "\n",
    "**Ans:**\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Global Scope**: Only **one** exists per program.  \n",
    "- **Local Scopes**: Multiple, one for each function or block.  \n",

    "#### 6. What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call returns?\n",
    "**Ans:** When a function call returns, **variables in the local scope are destroyed**. They exist only during the execution of the function and are removed from memory after the function finishes.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",

    "print(x)  # Error: NameError, x is not defined\n",

    "#### 9. How do you make a function variable refer to the global variable?\n",
    "**Ans:** To make a function variable refer to a global variable, use the **`global`** keyword inside the function. This tells Python to use the variable from the global scope instead of creating a local one.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 10  # Global variable\n",
    "\n",
    "def modify_global():\n",

    "print(x)  # Outputs: 20\n",
